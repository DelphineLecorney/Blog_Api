<h1 align="center">‚≠êÔ∏è Laravel RESTful API  ‚≠êÔ∏è</h1>

<h2 align="center">Hi , I'm Delphine  üëã</h2>  

<h3 align="center">This repository is a php exercise carried out during Becode training   </h3> <br>

<h2 align="left"><img src="https://github.com/DelphineLecorney/photos-images-readme/blob/main/images/Overview.JPG"  height="50" width="50" /> Overview</h2> 

>This project aims to create a RESTful API using Laravel, implementing the MVC pattern (without the V - View component), and performing CRUD operations on a MySQL database using Eloquent ORM. The API will provide endpoints to manage posts data, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting posts. The data will be returned in JSON format.


The url of the API will be for example: http://localhost:8000/api/v1/posts

<h2 align="left">üì¶ Prerequisites</h2> 
<br>

>Before getting started with this project, you'll need the following installed on your system:

- PHP (>= 7.4)
- Composer (Dependency Manager for PHP)
- MyPHPAdmin (or any other supported database)
- Web Server (e.g., Apache, Nginx)

>Make sure you have these dependencies installed and properly configured on your machine before proceeding with the installation.
<br>
<h2 align="left">üöÄ Installation</h2>

1. Clonez ce d√©p√¥t de code sur votre machine locale :


* Clone the Repository
  ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Blog_Api.git
  ```
  
	```sh
	  cd Blog_Api
	```
* Create a database and update the .env file with your database credentials.
	```
    public function up(): void
    {
        Schema::create('posts', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->id();
            $table->string('title', 255);
            $table->text('body');
            $table->string('author', 255);
            $table->timestamps();
        });
    }
	```
* Install Composer dependencies using composer install.
* Generate a new application key by running php artisan key:generate.
* Run Laravel migrations to set up the required database tables using php artisan migrate.
* The API will now be accessible at http://localhost:8000/api/v1/.
<br><br>
<h2 align="left"><img src="https://github.com/DelphineLecorney/photos-images-readme/blob/main/images/JWT.JPG"  height="50" width="50" />JWT Authentication  </h2>

>To implement an authentication system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens), you can follow these steps:

* Install the required package:
	```
	composer require tymon/jwt-auth
	```
* Publish the package configuration file:
	```
	php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Tymon\JWTAuth\Providers\LaravelServiceProvider"
	```
* Generate a secret key for JWT:
	```
	php artisan jwt:secret
	```
* Update the .env file to configure JWT:
	```
	Update the .env file to configure JWT:
	```
* Create a new controller for handling authentication:
	```
	php artisan make:controller AuthController
	```
In this controller, implement methods for registration, login, logout, etc., using JWT for token-based authentication.

* Define routes for authentication in the routes/api.php file.

	|-- composer.json        # Composer package manager configuration
	|-- README.md            # Project README (this file)
```
<br>

* Laravel already includes its routing system, so there's no need to install a separate router package.
* Use Thunder Client (VSCode extension) or Postman to test the API endpoints and verify responses.
<br>
<h4>Pay attention to HTTP status codes (e.g., 200, 201, 400, 404, 500) to understand the API's behavior.</h4>

</a>


<h4>Status Code: 200</h4>

>Description: The request was successful, and the server has returned the requested data.
Usage in Code: Returned when a post is successfully deleted from the database. It indicates that the deletion process was successful, and the post was removed.

<h4>Status Code: 201</h4>

>The request succeeded, and a new resource was created as a result. This is typically the response sent after POST requests, or some PUT requests.

<h4>Status Code: 400</h4>

>The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).

<h4>Status Code: 404 </h4>

>Not Found
Description: The server could not find the requested resource.
Usage in Code: Returned when attempting to delete a post with an ID that does not exist in the database. It indicates that the post was not found and, therefore, cannot be deleted.

<h4>Status Code: 500</h4>

>Description: The server encountered an unexpected condition that prevented it from fulfilling the request.
Usage in Code: Returned if there is an error during the deletion process that is not expected or handled explicitly. This could include database errors or other unexpected exceptions.

## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.
